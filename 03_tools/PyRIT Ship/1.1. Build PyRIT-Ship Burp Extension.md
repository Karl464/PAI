# 🛠️ Build PyRIT-Ship Burp Extension (Quick Guide)

This chapter shows you how to **compile the PyRIT-Ship Burp Suite extension** so you can use it inside Burp for automated prompt injection testing. More details on [PyRIT-Ship burp extension](https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT-Ship/blob/main/docs/burp_extension.md)

## ✅ Prerequisites
Before building, make sure you have:

- **Java JDK 21** → [Download](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/21)  
- **Gradle 8.5** → [Download](https://gradle.org/releases/)  
- **Git** → to clone the repository  

👉 Add both Java and Gradle to your system **PATH** so they can be used from the terminal.

Quick check in PowerShell:

```powershell
$Env:PATH -split ';' | Select-String -Pattern "bin"
```

---

## 📂 Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open PowerShell or your terminal and run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT-Ship.git
cd PyRIT-Ship\burp_extension\pyritship
```

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Build the Extension
You have two options:

**Option A (recommended): Gradle Wrapper**  
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
```

**Option B: Installed Gradle**  
```powershell
gradle build
```

---

## 📦 Step 3: Locate the Output
After a successful build, the extension `.jar` file will be created in:

```
PyRIT-Ship\burp_extension\pyritship\build\libs\
```

File generated:  
```
pyritship-0.0.1.jar
```

## 📝 Notes & Tips
- Always check that **Java JDK 21** and **Gradle 8.5** are correctly set in your PATH.  
- If you hit errors, try using the **Gradle wrapper (`gradlew.bat`)** instead of the global Gradle installation — it ensures consistency.  
- This build process has been tested with **PyRIT-Ship v0.9.0**.
